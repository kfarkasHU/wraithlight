# wraithlight

## **The original `wraithlight` repo has been renamed to `wraithlight-mono` and has been changed to have PRIVATE visibility, due to copyright issues.**

The repository was originally under MIT license, but later on it has been changed to LGPLv3 license.
Until figuring out the new structure of the open-source approach, the repository will be private, and this repo will be used as issue tracker (not milestone related issues).

Please come back to this repo to see any updates regarding the development timeline (will be added soon) and the updates that has been made on our current proceeding.
